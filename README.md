# Google Keep - Full Screen - Chrome Extension

## Latest Version: 1.2.1
 - Allows Google Keep editing to use the full browser window.
 - Allows toggling full screen on and off.
 - Supports Dark Mode

## Warning
Use this extension at your own risk. It shouldn't cause problems, but I can't make any guarantees, so back up critical notes.

## Note
This extension only works with the web version of Google Keep (eg. https://keep.google.com/keep/) - it won't work with the "app" version (the one you might install and launch from your app menu in Chrome, especially for offline use).

## Instructions
Fullscreen is enabled by default when you install the extension.  As of 1.1.1, fullscreen is
supported for creating new notes in addition to editing notes.  Use the icon to toggle fullscreen on and off as needed.
